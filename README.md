# Remote-control
Remote control software project



Most of the documentation is done at caiusinfo.data.blog, which is the project page. 
The blog posts go over all the project work being done.
If you're interested in the methods and processes beyond the code, please visit the project page. 

## As of 3.4.2021, the program is capable of:

- Executing commands remotely
- Establishing an encrypted connection between the server and the client
- Being undetected by Windows Defender (other antivirus not tested yet)


There are two released versions of the program, 0.1 and 0.11. These offer the basic
functionality of the program, but are by no means the end-product, as they are in alpha releases.
