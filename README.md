# Remote-control
Remote control software project



Most of the documentation is done at caiusinfo.data.blog, which is the project page. 
The blog posts go over all the project work being done.
If you're interested in the methods and processes beyond the code, please visit the project page. 
Project posts get released weekly, though changes come to github as they are made.

## As of 3.6.2021, the program is capable of:

- Executing commands remotely
- Establishing an encrypted connection between the server and the client
- Being undetected by Windows Defender (other antivirus not tested yet)
- Able to download/upload files to and from target

Keep an eye out for any new releases, I typically release them after adding some important
functionality to the program.
